## Understanding Federal Jobs
- Series: Numbered system for grouping similar occupations. The occupational groups or job families correlate jobs into numbered series
- You can determine your Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) to Federal Job series correlation using [Mil2FedJobs](https://www.dllr.state.md.us/mil2fedjobs/)
## Pay Scale & Grade
- The GS pay schedule has 15 pay grades and 10 steps in each grade
- The steps within each grade can be related to a federal employeeâ€™s tenure
- Step increases are raises in salary and occur over time similar to longevity increases
- In some circumstances, starting pay and steps can be negotiated based on your experience and/or education
