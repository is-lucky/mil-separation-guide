## Making the Decision to Separate
- The earlier the better, ideally 2+ years in advance
- Do the Virtual Transition Assistance Program (TAP)
  - Once done it is good for two years
  - You don't have to tell anyone that you did it - just save the certificates for later if needed
- Create a plan
  - Target careerfield/degree
  - Savings goal
  - Housing
    - If you plan to mortgage a house keep in mind the 2 year employment history expectation, especially if you are changing career fields  
## First Steps
- Meet with your commander
- Start reaching out to SkillBridge coordinators and prepare to interview
  - If you start early enough these can be very low key meeting where you get a chance to feel each other out and see if it would be worth applying for later
- Network
  - Find civilian mentor(s)
## Finding a SkillBridge
- Again, the earlier the better
- Have a target list of programs/providers and start working through the applications
- When they ask for you availability:
  - Don't give one company you whole availability (it will put you in an awkward position when someone else then asks and you don't know what date/time the first company might select yet)
  - Instead pick a few dates/times for each company and assume others will want to interview in the same week
## Getting Orders
- Air Force:
  - Search either Officer Separations or Enlisted Separations on myFSS and select Separation Orders
  - Scroll to bottom and select Create Request
  - Add relevant information
  - Attach a copy of approved skillbridge (if applicable) or terminal leave
  - To established Place of Entry, attach a copy of Statement of Service, Oath of Office, and/or Career Data Brief (for Officers) or DD4 (for Enlisted)
## Household Goods(HHG) & Non-Temporary Storage(NTS)
- The system is outdated and a lot of TMOs are... let's say "busy." Get to this asap and do as much as you possibly can on your own
### Non-Temporary Storage(NTS)
- Why you might choose this option:
  - You don't have an address yet or even know for sure where you will be
  - You are going to be living in a furnished place for a bit and need a place for your old stuff for the time being
- NTS is available for 180 days free of charge following a member's DoS (365 for retiring)
- The release shipment is free of charge
### Household Goods(HHG)
- Why you might choose this option:
  - You have kids and pets that you have to deal with
  - You have heavy stuff you don't want to deal with
  - You don't have the time
  - Your body can't handle it
- DO NOT TIP THE MOVERS (this used to be a thing, but DoD said to stop. If they aren't going to be diligent or have loose morals, then they will break/steal your stuff regardless)
- Check your weight entitlement and do not go over this amount
### Personally Procurred Move(PPM)
- Why you might choose this option:
  - You can make the money for the move yourself
  - Your stuff is less likely to get stolen/broken (unless it happens in transit, remember to secure your trailer, park in well lit parking lots, etc.)
  - Your timeline and mover availability won't work
- Can be partial or all of it
- Make sure you get weights empty and full from an authorized weigh station and that the date is legible (and after your orders were issued)
