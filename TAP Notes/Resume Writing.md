# Resume Writing
## Master Resume
- Full employment history and accomplishments (using STAR, situation-task-action-result, format)
- All skills, certifications, knowledge areas, etc.
- NEVER submit to an employer as part of application
- DO use to create a targeted resume for a specific posting
- May include:
  - Employer's name, city and state
  - Supervisor's name and contact information (will need to be reviewed/updated)
  - Job title
  - Start/Finish month and year
  - Duties and Responsibilities
  - Accomplishments
## Targeted Resume
- The goal of your targeted resume is to tell the employer that you match the skills and qualifications that they are seeking
- Starting from Master Resume, remove information that is not relevant to the posting
- Identify key Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) that match the job posting
- Make explicit connections for the employer to easily see how specific skills/qualifications are a match to the job’s requirements
- What are the key skills or keywords listed in the posting and that this company cares about?
## Resume Styles
### Chronological (reverese order with latest at top):
  - Most preferred by employers
  - Describes experiences and accomplishments
  - Compatible with many ATS
### Functional (skill-based):
  - Sometimes frowned upon due to lack of specific employer/date information
  - Typically used by job seekers changing careers, with focus on transferable skills
  - Allows grouping of skills/accomplishments into categories
  - Also good for gaps in resume or creative industries where portfolio matters more than resume
### Combination:
  - Likely best for career changing without losing the specific information employers/ATS look for
  - Also good for positions that require lots of technical skills and expertise
## Preparing to Write
- Decide type and style of Resume you wish to write
- Use chronological if creating a Master
- Gather information: VMET for military, school transcripts, certifications, pevious job evaluations, military records, etc.
## Understanding Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Defined: Software that can track, collect, sort, and pinpoint resumes that meet required qualifications. It is a searchable system for the hiring organization. Some ATSs can also:
  - post job listings to multiple boards
  - determine where applicants located the job listing
  - schedule interviews
  - send emails to applicants
  - compile resumes
  - send alerts to company employees such as hiring manager and recruiters
### How it Works:
  1. Employer provides the job requirements and keywords to be used for accurately identifying the most qualified candidates
  2. The system analyzes a resume and establishes that it meets the predetermined requirements
  3. The system allows the candidate to progress forward in the hiring process
    - If an application contains minimal keywords, it will not be selected to move on to the hiring authorities
  - To ensure your application passes the ATS scan:
    - The best way to increase your chances of being selected to move forward in the hiring process is to ensure you are analyzing and using the job posting to target your resume 
    1. Add keywords and phrases that appear in the job description or job announcement throughout your resume
    2. When you attach or upload documents, **use the format requested in the application**, such as Word or PDF
    3. Avoid uploading charts or images unless otherwise instructed
    4. Use both the long-form and acronym version of keywords (e.g., “Master of Business Administration (MBA)” or “Search Engine Optimization (SEO)”) for maximum searchability
    5. Use a chronological or combination resume format (avoid the functional resume format because it doesn’t have dates and can confuse the ATS)
    6. Do not use tables or columns, as they often cause errors
    7. Do not use headers or footers, as the information might get lost or cause an error
## Analyzing a Job Posting
- Don't skim a listing for which you plan to apply so that you don't miss important details (full-time/part-time, etc.)
- Print out the listing and use a highlighter
- Verify qualifications against the minimum requirements particularly certs, licenses, degree, etc.
- Apply even if you do not have a preferred skill or ability if you have other qualifications
- Apply directly through the company website
- Beware any listings that ak for paying for training or purchasing a kit or training material as a condition of employment
- Selecting key words can be subjective. However, the goal is to select words that you believe stand out and can be connected to your own achievements
- Make a list of the keywords and phrases identified
  - Keywords & Phrases:
  - Job Requirements:
  - My Qualifications (those that meet or exceed):
## Scanning a Resume
